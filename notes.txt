The way I found out about an array is when I searched up devdocs.io. In devdocs, I had to set up Python 3.9 documentation.
Next we had to un select other preferences in order to just use Python 3.9.
In he Python 3.9 documentation there was a variety of many examples given to show you about different ways of how to use arrays
An array is not  a collection and is ordered meaningfully.
A collection is ordered in the same way of an array.
A collection is an array.
An array is a collection of many different values that can be accessed by index. Similar in how I do my webdevelopment assignments by doing index.html.
Arrays can structure data of any type such as 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. 
All data types can be structured because of its portability.
The reason why we use functions is because it is portable and reusable logic.
The way you can define a function by it's inputs and outputs, they are sets.
It is important to know what an array is because you can describe a function.
On line 13 I wrote a = arr.array and I had to put a space after a and the = sign or it won't run correct;y on the terminal.
On line 18 I wront b = arr.arry('l', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).
On line 20 I did not at all understand the print(b.pop()).
I understand that the print is used for an output to write information and on line 22 I wrote print("hello world")
