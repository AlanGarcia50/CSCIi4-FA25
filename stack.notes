First I started with a list that is called stack, stack[]
Then I put 3 numbers in order,1,2,3. I made in order so 3 can end up on top.
Then I put print, and the "print" prints the whole stack. An example is, ['1','2','3'].
The stack.pop() takes off and returns the '1'. The 3 was added last, so it's basically removed and saved.
Top Element = [-1] basically means the last thing added in the list, since the top of stack is always the last added.
Print ("size", len(stack)) can count how many of the the numbers are left.
I pushed three items, and I had popped '3', ad I peeked the new '2', then the print(print"size", len(stack)) counts how many numbers are still in the stack.
I used w3 schools for references.
